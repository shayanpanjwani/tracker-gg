TrackerGG is an application that reads a local CSV file of my League of Legends games from this year, and
displays them in a table format, intuitively sortable by clicking on the headers.

All data was pulled using Riot's API, and represents a snapshots of actual games that I played.

To run the file, run the App.java file at 
"\trackergg\src\main\java\com\shayan\App.java". Enjoy!
